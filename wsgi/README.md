# Main Idea
Manage the todo in stack-way. Always focus on the top item/task of stack.

# How to use?
You should push anything as soon as it flashed in your mind. To organize your todos, you can drop and drop to sort these todos. After your task has done, click on the *Pop* button to move your todo to *trash stack*. 

# Import
This is an *experimental* todos management tools, which means there is no guarantee that this tool can make you life better!

# Current State
+ We are in features defining state, so feel free to tell me your idea.
+ Each stack is stored as a file, and each todo is stored as a line in file.
+ You can create your stack by appending by the end of URL i.e http://stack-todos.lanyitin.tw/$stackName
+ Every stack is *public*
+ For now, this project is hosted on Heroku.

# We may add following features in future
+ Disqus integration for each todo
+ add timestamp to each todo
+ Collaboration (this is the feature I want to implement first, but I don't how exactly do it)
